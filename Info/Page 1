        <h1>What makes up a Bacteria</h1> <br/>
        <h5> From Wikipedia, Britnicana, Ecelopidia </h5>
        <br/>
        <p>A Bacteria is a cell that is living. They live in our body, are in foods we eat, and live all around us. A Bacteria cell
        must be a rod,sphere, or a spiral shape.  </p> <br/>
        <h5> <i> <strong> What all bacteria contain within </strong> </i> </h5>
        <p> All bacteria conatian no nucleus which makes the prokaroyte. They also contain no internal structures such as mitochondria,
        ribosomes, cholorplasts. Bacteria are the most abdent organism on the earth. Bacteria are also unicellular. </p> <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>There are two diffrent types of Bacteria, they were clasified as Bacteria and then split into two catagories. </p>
        
        <h2> <strong> Eukarya </strong> </h2>
        <p>Eukarya or, Eubacteria as they were orginally called are enclosed in a cell wall. The cell wall is made by peptidoglycan.
        The peptidoglycan combines the amino acids and suger chains. This makes it so that the cell wall always keeps it's shape and can
        face chemicals.</p> <br/>
        <p>The Bacterial Cell has a plasma membrane and moves using its' flagella. The Plasma Membrane like most of its brothers 
        conatins a Phosophlid bilayer that has proteins all around the outside. Although unlike its' brothers and sisters the Eukarya Bacteria cells
        do not contain any organelles inside the cell boundraires.</p> <br/>

        <h5> Archea </h5> <br/>
        <p>Archea is another type of Bacteria. As seen above it is the closet relative to Bacteria. The Archea Bacteria cells lack a 
        a nucleus. They have very diffrent molecule structures than Bacteria in which that seperates them from their brothers.</p>
