        <h2> <strong> Eukarya </strong> </h2>
        <p>Eukarya or, Eubacteria as they were orginally called are enclosed in a cell wall. The cell wall is made by peptidoglycan.
        The peptidoglycan combines the amino acids and suger chains. This makes it so that the cell wall always keeps it's shape and can
        face chemicals.</p> <br/>
